The term "Circuit Breaker" comes from the circuit knowledge in physics. Its function is to quickly cut off the power supply to protect the safety of the circuit when the circuit fails.

In the field of microservices, the circuit breaker was first proposed by Martin Fowler in his article "[Circuit Breaker](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CircuitBreaker.html)". Similar to the function of the Circuit Breaker in physics, the Circuit Breaker in the microservice architecture can return an expected and processable degradation response (FallBack) to the service caller after a service fails, instead of a long time Wait or throw an exception that the caller cannot handle. This ensures that the thread of the service caller will not be occupied unnecessarily for a long time, avoiding the spread of faults in the microservice system, and preventing the occurrence of system avalanche effects.
